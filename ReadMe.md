# CBA 14

My internet connection isn't great, so this ReadMe file is meant to serve instead of a demo.  If you'd like me to do one anyway, I'll be happy to.

As per the [assignment](https://github.com/WolfElkan/LMC-20S-CSC2635-CBA14/blob/master/assignment.md), I started with the code for [`Total.java`](https://github.com/WolfElkan/LMC-20S-CSC2635-CBA14/blob/ee23076d4e593e13483c1e40e81b925c3c46a30e/Total.java), as well as the [input data file](https://github.com/WolfElkan/LMC-20S-CSC2635-CBA14/blob/master/input.txt).  I then modified `Test.java` as [shown here](https://github.com/WolfElkan/LMC-20S-CSC2635-CBA14/commit/957e1c8cc4102ee0d7c1f1819e01578359ed7f4e#diff-0b6b5fb0dd9f75a24a1d3eee2a56fa64) so that it writes the data in two columns.
